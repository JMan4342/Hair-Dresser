## Project Description

Web application for a hairdresser’s clients. Her clients can visit this page to see the services she offers as well as her previous work through a collage of photos directly from the hairdresser’s Facebook page. Clients can leave their contact information so that the hairdresser can get in touch with them. The client's information will be saved in local storage to thank the client for their submission and to personalize the page for them for when they revisit. Clients can also look at the location of the salon with the option to navigate there with Google Maps.
